Welcome to your training.

Let's begin.

The process generally involves the following steps (in order):

1. **Sanitization:** It is crucial to sanitize all equipment before brewing to ensure that no unwanted bacteria or microorganisms contaminate the beer.

2. **Mashing:** This step involves heating grains in water to create a sweet liquid called wort. The temperature and time of the mash affect the final flavor and body of the beer.

3. **Boiling:** The wort is boiled for about an hour with hops to add bitterness, flavor, and aroma to the beer.

4. **Fermentation:** The boiled wort is cooled and transferred to a fermentation vessel, where yeast is added to convert the sugars in the wort into alcohol and carbon dioxide. The beer is allowed to ferment for a week or two.

5. **Bottling or kegging:** After fermentation is complete, the beer is either bottled with a small amount of sugar to carbonate it or transferred to a keg for carbonation and serving.

6. **Conditioning:** The bottled or kegged beer is conditioned at room temperature for a few weeks to allow the flavors to develop and the carbonation to stabilize.
