# What you need

==- Water
This is probably the most important ingredient. Now you have a few options:

- **Tap water:** Readily available and safe to drink. However, tap water can vary widely in its mineral content, pH, and chlorine/chloramine levels, which can affect the taste and quality of the beer. To use tap water for brewing, it is recommended to test its mineral content and pH and adjust it as needed to suit the desired beer style.
  - So I was lucky and able to find a water profile for London Ontario on [Brewer's Friend](https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/water-profiles) - I have not been able to find one for Barrie though. However, I asked ChatGPT to figure it out and it actually came back with reasonable numbers, and from the Barrie Water Reports so I averaged things out, and came up with:

Calcium | Magnesium | Sodium  | Chloride  | Sulfate
---     | ---       | ---     | ---       |
27      | 10        | 17      | 25        | 25


- **Filtered water:** Some homebrewers use filtered water, such as reverse osmosis (RO) or carbon-filtered water, to ensure a consistent and clean water source. This can be especially useful in areas with highly mineralized or chlorinated tap water. However, filtered water may lack the mineral content needed for proper yeast health and flavor development in the beer, so it may need to be supplemented with brewing salts and minerals.

- **Distilled water:** Same as filtered water basically. Gives you a base to build on with brewing salts and minerals.

==- Grain
**Base grains:** also known as **base malt** These are the primary source of fermentable sugars in the beer and typically make up the majority of the grain bill. The most commonly used base grains are:

- *2-row malted barley:* a neutral-flavored grain that is widely used in many beer styles. This is what I use for an ipa/pale ale/ale - I buy 55 lb bags of this since I will use like 9 lbs per receipe, 55 lb bags will run around 70 bucks)
- *Pilsner malt:* a pale malt that is commonly used in Pilsners and other light-colored beers. I've used this for lager/pilsner/helles type beers. I've not had success with any of those beers but it's likely due to me lacking temperature control, no the grain. Some people swear by pilsner for NEIPA recipes but I haven't tried it.
- *Vienna malt:* a slightly darker malt that adds a toasty, bready flavor to the beer. I have used this before but not as a base malt. Added 1 or 1 lbs before to something I want that toasty/bready flavour in, like a brown ale, or porter.
- *Maris Otter:* an English malt that imparts a nutty, biscuity flavor to the beer. Makes your beer taste like an English beer. I have used it once to make an IPA, turned out to be an English IPA, I am not a fan of many English beers so I don't fuck with this, it's usually more expensive than others also.

**Specialty grains:** These are grains that are added in smaller amounts to contribute specific flavors, colors, and aromas to the beer. Some common specialty grains include:

- *Crystal malt:* also know as caramel malt -- a caramelized malt that adds sweetness, body, and color to the beer. I usually throw a lb of this in a west coast IPA.
- *Roasted barley:* a heavily roasted grain that imparts a coffee or chocolate flavor to the beer. Usually use this in a stout of porter.
- *Chocolate malt:* a lightly roasted malt that adds a chocolatey flavor and color to the beer. Stout or porter.
- *Wheat malt:* a malted wheat grain that is often used in Belgian-style beers and wheat beers. This makes your blue moonie type white beers, but also a key ingredient in NEIPA's

**Adjuncts:** These are non-grain ingredients that are sometimes added to the beer to contribute specific flavors, aromas, or characteristics. Common adjuncts include:

- *Corn or rice:* used in American-style lagers to lighten the body and increase fermentable sugars - I also use corn in a cream ale.
- *Oats:* added to stouts and porters to add creaminess and smoothness to the beer - another key ingredient in a NEIPA

==- Hops
There are sooo many hop varieties. This is a brief overview of some of them:

**Bittering hops:** These are added early in the boil to impart bitterness to the beer. They typically have a high alpha acid content, which is responsible for the bitter flavor. Some common bittering hops include:

- *Magnum:* a high-alpha acid hop with a clean, neutral flavor that is often used in IPAs and other hop-forward beers
- *Warrior:* a high-alpha acid hop with a clean, bitter flavor that is often used in American-style ales
- *Chinook:* a high-alpha acid hop with a piney, spicy flavor that is often used in IPAs and other hop-forward beers

**Flavor and aroma hops:** These are added later in the boil, typically in the last 15-20 minutes, to add flavor and aroma to the beer. They have a lower alpha acid content and a more complex flavor profile than bittering hops. Some common flavor and aroma hops include:

- *Cascade:* a popular hop with a floral, citrusy flavor that is often used in American-style ales and IPAs
- *Centennial:* a versatile hop with a floral, citrusy flavor that is often used in American-style ales and IPAs
- *Saaz:* a classic European hop with a spicy, herbal flavor that is often used in Pilsners and other light-colored beers

**Dual-purpose hops:** These hops can be used for both bittering and flavor/aroma purposes. They have a moderate alpha acid content and a balanced flavor profile that works well in many beer styles. Some common dual-purpose hops include:

- *Simcoe:* a hop with a piney, citrusy flavor that is often used in IPAs and other hop-forward beers
- *Amarillo:* a hop with a fruity, floral flavor that is often used in American-style ales and IPAs
- *Northern Brewer:* a hop with a woody, minty flavor that is often used in English-style ales and lagers

**Holy Trinity:** Some people say the IPA holy trinity is citra, mosaic, simcoe. Citra is like a cheater hop, if you buy 1 hop in bulk, make it citra.
==- Yeast
There are two main types of yeast used in homebrewing: *ale yeast* and *lager yeast*. Here's an overview of each:

**Ale yeast:** Ale yeast is a top-fermenting yeast that works best at warmer temperatures, typically between 65-75째F (18-24째C). Some common strains of ale yeast include:

- *American Ale:* a clean, neutral yeast that is often used in American-style ales and IPAs. This is what I use for 90% of my beers. Fermentis US-05 -- It's cheap and it works.
- *English Ale:* a yeast that produces fruity, estery flavors and is often used in English-style ales. This is what I use for NEIPA's. Fermentis S-04 -- It's cheap and it works, I find it accentuates fruitier characters, which makes it good for NEIPA.

**Lager yeast:** Lager yeast is a bottom-fermenting yeast that works best at colder temperatures, typically between 45-55째F (7-13째C).

- I only have experience with SafLager W-34/70, which is the preferred dry yeast lager strain, but I have not had luck with it. Again I think it's due to the temperature range that I can't reliably hit.

In addition to these main types of yeast, there are also many specialty yeast strains available to homebrewers that can produce a wide range of flavors and aromas, such as *saison yeast*, *sour yeast*, and *wild yeast*.

**Dry vs liquid yeast:** For most types of yeast there are dry varieties and liquid varieties. Here are the differences:

- *dry:*
  - cheaper
  - last longer
  - will work for anything you are doing
  - examples: US-05, S-04, saflager 34/70
- *liquid:*
  - expensive
  - expire quickly
  - more options
  - examples: Imperial Harvest, White Labs California Ale

There have been many comparisons in terms of performance and taste and no statistical differences. just use dry yeast it's way easier.
