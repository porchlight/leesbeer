# Where to buy

Similar to equipment, minus Amazon since they don't really have any beer ingredients.

**Ontario Beer Kegs (OBK)**
  - Have a good cheap selection of 5 gallon recipe kits. I would start by brewing a few of these until you know enough to start making your own recipes.

**Local Homebrew Store (LHBS)**
  - Good for one off things if you need to reup on some brewing salts, or missing a pound of something, but their hop and grain selection sucks compared to OBK.
