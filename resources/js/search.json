Because of that, the measurements on the inside are not accurate. I would always measure the water before pouring in with a bucket that has the measurements on it.","The other annoying thing about this is the temperature probe sticks into the kettle kinda far, so you have to remember its there when you pull our your brew bag or you could snag the back on it. It's also a pain when you are stirring the wort when trying to cool it down. You could take this out of the port and get a plug instead and just rely on an instant read thermometer if you wanted, but it's not THAT bad, just minor annoyance. It does give an accurate reading at least.","This is a big ass kettle. You probably could do 10 gallon batches in it, but I have never tried.","This is the official, gold standard brew bag purchased from https://www.brewinabag.com/-- This shit rules, its super easy to work with and easy to clean. Their site has good general brewing instructions and a video too for how to use it in your brew https://www.brewinabag.com/pages/instructions-- highly recommend reading and watching.","Bought this off amazon, haven't had any issues with it. You should be able to get 4-5 brews on one propane tank. I just make sure I've always got backup","This is a vital tool. You need this to measure starting gravity (SG) and final gravity (FG) and any other gravity readings you may want to check along the way. Long story short, you use this to measure the SG before you add yeast. Then you measure it again in a few days when fermentation is complete to give you your FG. You then take these two numbers and find an online calculator to figure out your ABV. You have to have this. The flask and hydrometer itself should be under $20. Can get this on amazon or OBK, or LHBS probably.","You need this to measure out brewing salts, hops, and grains if you start buying in bulk. This is the one I have, it works great and is cheap as shit https://a.co/d/e2GgZfP","You need these for dry-hopping. You put your hops in a bag then use magnets to stick the bag to the top of your fermentor. After a few days you remove the magnet on top of your femermentor and then the hops drop in.
