# Glossary

### A

**adjunct** - any substitute unmalted grain or fermentable ingredient added to a mash. Reduces cost and produces lighter-bodied, paler, and less malty beers.

**aeration** - exposing a substance to air, performed at various stages of the brewing process.

**airlock (or fermentation lock)** - a one-way valve that allows carbon dioxide gas to escape while preventing the entry of contaminants.

**ale** - a generic term for beers produced by top fermentation (i.e. using ale yeast strains) at temperatures higher than lager fermentation temperatures; wort usually made by infusion mashing.

**alpha acid** - the soft, bitter hop resin responsible for most of beer¹s bitterness. Alpha acids must be boiled to convert alpha acids to iso-alpha acids. Measured as a percentage of the total weight of the hop cone.

**alpha acid units (AAU)** - percentage of alpha acids in a sample of hops multiplied by the weight in ounces of the entire sample. (One ounce of hops with an alpha-acid content of 5 percent contains 5 AAUs.) AAU values are used in the calculation of BUs and IBUs.

**all-grain beer** - a beer made entirely from malted grains, as opposed to beers made from malt extract.

### B

**bitterness units (BU)** - a system to express the bitterness in beer with a unit based on alpha acid content. The homebrewers’ bittering unit estimates the bitterness of hopped malt extract by multiplying the amount of hops by the alpha acid unit of the hops used.

**body (or mouthfeel)** - the consistency, thickness, and sensation of fullness created by beer in the mouth.

**boil** - the step in brewing when the sweet wort is transferred to a brew kettle and boiled with hops to produce a bitter wort.

**bottle-conditioned** - beer carbonated naturally in the bottle by priming or re-yeasting.

**break** - the clumping and separation of protein matter during the boiling stage (hot break) and cooling stage (cold break).

**buttery** - having a taste like butter or butterscotch, signifying the presence of diacetyl.

### C

**caramel malt** - a malt that is prepared by “stewing” (kilning in a moist environment) to produce sugars from starch (the sugars caramelize when the malt is dried to yield color and flavor compounds). Also called **crystal malt**.

**carbonation** - injecting or dissolving carbon dioxide gas in a liquid to create a bubbly taste and texture.

**secondary fermentation** - the second, slower stage of fermentation that takes place after primary fermentation has forced solids out of solution and the brew is racked to a closed bin (the “secondary fermenter”).

**sediment** - the solid material that falls out of solution during fermentation (more so in the primary fermentation, but also in the secondary for certain brews.)

**six-row barley** - a variety of barley that grows six rows of grains and has more husk material by proportion than the more pristine two-row variety. The result is a less developed grain that yields less in the way of extract.

**skimming** - the process of removing the top layer of yeast that forms on the head of the brew during primary fermentation (with a tool known as a skimming oar). Brewers can utilize this process to save the yeast for later use.

**smoked malt** - a smoky flavored malt that gains its flavor through drying over open fire.

**soft water** - water that is free of calcium, magnesium, cholorine, iron and other elements that otherwise contribute to “hard water.”

**sparge** - a process that brewers conduct during mashing in which spent grains are sprayed with hot water in order to extract the remaining sugars from the husks.

**specific gravity (SG)** - a measurement that represents the density of a liquid at a specified temperature. Pure water is given a value of 1.000 SG at 39 ºC (4 ºC). This measurement is highly used in brewing in order to monitor various processes from boiling throughout fermentation.
 
### T

**terminal gravity** - a term used to define the specific gravity after a beer has fermented and aged appropriately. A synonym that is commonly used is final gravity.

**tertiary fermentation** - this is a fermentation that is carried out in bottles as a conditioning technique.

**thermometer** - a tool for measuring temperature. Thermometers specifically made for brewing use alternative materials to mercury (such as alcohol) as a precautionary measure, so that if the thermometers break, no poisonous chemicals will infect the beer.

**toasted malt** - a pale malt that is kilned for varying amounts of time, at different temperatures in order to produce certain “toasty” flavor characteristics.

**top fermentation** - a fermentation method that utilizes yeast that hover on the surface as opposed to sinking to the bottom. Ales are “top fermented” beers while lagers are bottom fermented.

**topping up** - A term used to define the addition of water after boiling a concentrated wort or extract; or the practice of adding water after primary fermentation in order to decrease the head space and prevent air contamination.

### V

**viscosity** - As an adjective, this descriptor refers to body and mouthfeel, but it literally refers to the resistance of liquid (beer) to flow ‹ i.e. its thickness.

**vorlauf** - German word referring to the process of recirculating wort through the grain bed.
 
### W
