# What you need

==- Brew Kettle
- [x] obtained

This was acquired from that weird auction site and it is kind of mishapen. Because of that, the measurements on the inside are not accurate. I would always measure the water before pouring in with a bucket that has the measurements on it.

The other annoying thing about this is the temperature probe sticks into the kettle kinda far, so you have to remember its there when you pull our your brew bag or you could snag the back on it. It's also a pain when you are stirring the wort when trying to cool it down. You could take this out of the port and get a plug instead and just rely on an instant read thermometer if you wanted, but it's not THAT bad, just minor annoyance. It does give an accurate reading at least.

This is a big ass kettle. You probably could do 10 gallon batches in it, but I have never tried.
==- Brew Bag
- [x] obtained

This is the official, gold standard brew bag purchased from https://www.brewinabag.com/ -- This shit rules, its super easy to work with and easy to clean. Their site has good general brewing instructions and a video too for how to use it in your brew https://www.brewinabag.com/pages/instructions -- highly recommend reading and watching.
==- Propane Burner
- [x] obtained

Bought this off amazon, haven't had any issues with it. You should be able to get 4-5 brews on one propane tank. I just make sure I've always got backup
==- Hydrometer and flask
- [ ] obtained

This is a vital tool. You need this to measure starting gravity (SG) and final gravity (FG) and any other gravity readings you may want to check along the way. Long story short, you use this to measure the SG before you add yeast. Then you measure it again in a few days when fermentation is complete to give you your FG. You then take these two numbers and find an online calculator to figure out your ABV. You have to have this. The flask and hydrometer itself should be under $20. Can get this on amazon or OBK, or LHBS probably.
==- Digital Scale
- [ ] obtained

You need this to measure out brewing salts, hops, and grains if you start buying in bulk. This is the one I have, it works great and is cheap as shit https://a.co/d/e2GgZfP
==- Wort Chiller
- [x] obtained

You can use my old one but YOU WILL NEED TO BUY HOSE CLAMPS in order to keep the hoses connected. What this is is a copper coil. You attach it to your house water to run cold water through the tubing, you put this in your wort after the boil to cool down your wort quicker. Apparently the longer you take to cool your wort the more susceptible your beer is to infection, but this is kind of a myth. Really though you want to cool it down fast so you can get the day over with quicker. The key thing is, you can't pitch (add) your yeast until the temperature of the wort is below 80 degrees. I usually use this thing to get to like 90, then I'll transfer it to my fermenter, move my fermenter downstairs and clean up everything else, then go down and toss the yeast in.
==- Hose Clamps
- [] obtained

You will need at least 4 to keep the hoses all attached to everything. You don't want to end up with hose water in your brew kettle.
==- Food Grade Magnets
- [x] obtained

You need these for dry-hopping. You put your hops in a bag then use magnets to stick the bag to the top of your fermentor. After a few days you remove the magnet on top of your femermentor and then the hops drop in. More on dry-hopping in the process section.
==- Brew paddle/spoon
- [ ] obtained

You need a big spoon or paddle to stir in the grains so you don't get "doughballs", basically clumps of grain that stick together and wouldn't have their sugars extracted properly. You need to break them up when you dump in the grain. Also, stir the wort post-boil helps to chill the work.
==- BBQ Lighter
- [x] obtained

Need a bbq lighter to light the propane burner. Could use a match or bic but id highly recommend a bbq lighter.
==- Grain mill and board
- [ ] obtained

You won't need this right away but this is used to "crush" the grains. You need the grains to be crushed before you mash. Basically its busting open the grains to expose the fermentable sugars. When I started I just bought my grains pre-crushed. So wherever I bought my grain from, they would crush them for me. It costs a little extra but it's only noticeable after doing a lot of batches. Once I made the decision to buy in bulk since I was using a lot of the same grain, then I had to buy a grain mill in order to crush my own grains. I did the math at some point and it would pay for itself after like 15 brews, so I'm probably just coming up on that now. Anyways, you don't need this until you know you like doing this.
==- Instant read thermometer
- [ ] obtained

This isn't absolutely necessary if you have another termometer, but the one I got is off amazon and was pretty cheap. It's good for meat too if you don't have one already. Sometimes I need to check the temp of the wort with this for instance when I'm taking a hydrometer reading, I want to know the temperature of the wort because that plays into the reading. This one is cheap and works great https://a.co/d/f6KKbD3
==- Bar Keepers Friend
- [ ] obtained

This is a cleaning powder similar to Comet,  it's made for cleaning metal, like stainless steel, silver, copper, shit like that. You can get it at any hardware store for like 7 bucks, lasts forever.
==- OxiClean
- [ ] obtained

This is a more affordable substitute for "PBW". It's another cleaning powder. You need to use this to sanitize your equipment before you begin your brew. I will explain everything about cleaning, but you absoltely need this shit. and UNSCENTED - here it is on amazon https://a.co/d/aR37YkU - shit lasts forever.
==- Airlock and #10 rubber bung
- [ ] obtained

An air lock if a little plastic thing that you use on your fermentation bucket in order to let out CO2 that the yeast puts out, and keep O2 out. You want to do everything you can to avoid "oxygenating" your beer after the yeast has started. It can cause off flavours. Anyways, you take one of these things, close your fermenter and put the rubber bung in the hole, and then stick this airlock in the bung and poor some water in it to keep oxygen out of your fermenter. You probably want a couple airlocks cause they break kinda easy if you are tough with them.
==- Buckets
- [ ] obtained

You need at least 3 brew buckets. You need them to have gallon measurements written on them. 1 bucket you will be using as your fermenter so it needs a lid with a hole in it (for your bung and airlock), and it should also have a spigot to make bottling day a hell of a lot easier. The other two buckets are good to have. One can be your grain bucket, so you can prep your brew by putting all your grains in this bucket (especially useful if you are crushing your own). The third bucket can be your wet bucket, use it for measuring out your brewing water, and sanitizing tools and stuff prior to racking the wort to your fermentor.
==- Dry hop bag
- [x] obtained

You need at least 1 of these in order to dry hop your beer. 2 if you want to "DDH". Basically it's just a mesh bag that you can put hops in. I will detail the dry hopping process later.
==- Pipe cleaners
- [ ] obtained

Good to have a ring of different sizes of these for cleaning ball valves. Link to amazon ones https://a.co/d/idiDRUZ
==- Star San
- [ ] obtained

Must have sanitizing solution. It's acid so don't get to much on your hands, I do all the time, but it makes them dry so I try to avoid. Basically ANYTHING that your beer will come in contact with has to be sanitized and this is what that is for. You will get used to using this a lot.
==- Spray bottle
- [ ] obtained

Super handy to have this for sanitizing stuff qucikly. I mix a little bit of star san and water in the spray bottle so if I need to touch something with my ands like the spigot of the kettle or something, I can just use this to spray the spigot to quick sanitize it.
==- Strainer
- [ ] obtained

Not totally necessary but I like to put a steel mesh strainer (sanitized) under my kettle spigot when transferring the wort to the fermentor. This helps with two things: 1) it keeps crud out of the fermenter. 2) it helps to aerate the wort. Apparently you want your wort to be well aerated before you put yeast on it, so this is good for that.
==- Tylonol dropper
- [ ] obtained

Handy to have this for measuring and adding hydrochloric acid to your strike water.
==- Bottling wand
- [ ] obtained

You can attach this to your bottling bucket's spigot with a small piece of 1/8" tubing. You attach it to your spigot and then open the spigot valve to drain the wort into your bottles. What this wand does is it has a spring in it to keep the wort from coming out unless the spout is pushed against the bottom of your bottle. So you put this thing on and then wort only comes out when you put it into the bottom of a bottle. Its genious.
==- Dishwashing gloves
- [ ] obtained

Good to have cause some parts of the process involve touching hot water.
